# Facial Recognition System

This project aims to develop a facial recognition system capable of identifying faces in images and videos. The system utilizes machine learning algorithms, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and support vector machines (SVMs), to accurately detect and recognize individuals based on their facial features. The project also includes the development of a database of facial images to serve as a reference for the facial recognition system. The system will be implemented into a user-friendly interface for easy interaction.
